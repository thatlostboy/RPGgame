RPG Game: incomplete
It's 90% complete.  The rest of the work is mostly cosmetic.  


###### Psuedo Code for what the costmetic items remaining for you. 
1)  show starting health in each of the character buttons (right now it's in console and in the charcter object, but not displayed. )
2)  show selections in div with images instead of the buttons (need to select a nicer image, thiking mario bros)
        was going to use flexbox container, wrap feature, spacing parameter, and centered.   
        was going to add a hover to animate to engarge when hovered over selecting the characters
        div inside each box was going to be relative positioning (inside the flex box container), and do absolute positiong for text element like the character.baseHealth
3)  disable click functionality to the select another villian when in current fight (right now, the clicking for the villians is not disabled during a fight, i need to disable it)
4)  display the fight stats (attack for X points, health is down to X).  Right now the attack stats are only shown in the console.log.   Not on the screen.   
5)  add a nice background image, audio, and some sounds.
